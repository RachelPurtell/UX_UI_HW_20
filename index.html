            <h3>An App to Create Skincare Routines Emphasizing the Importance of Product Formulations and Skin Type </h3>
            <p><strong>Overview</strong> | Shël is an app designed to bring clarity and ease to a person's skincare routines. Through Shël a user can build and organize routines with cosmetic products they are familiar with as well as discover new products rating high in compatibility to their skin type. Upon building their routines users can amplify consistency by using Shël’s daily progress tracker to mark their routines as complete.  </p>

            <h3>How the Shël Prototype was Developed</h3>
            <p><strong>Timeline & Roles</strong> | This project came together as a group effort where I worked alongside Grant Ertl and Parinaz Kassemi during a 2 week time period. One of my main roles was to formulate research questions and conduct interviews to understand where individuals struggle the most when choosing products and organizing their skin care routines.
                We were able to apply this information along with other research methods to create a prototype that assists you from the very beginning of your skincare journey and adapts as your routine fluctuates</p>

                <h3>Where Can a Person Turn to When They Need Help with Their Skincare Routine?</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem Statement </strong>| Molly, a young professional and skincare enthusiast, continues to struggle on her pursuit of clear skin due to an inconsistent work schedule and an absence of knowledge about cosmetic ingredients. She strives to develop better habits and seeks assistance in finding what would work best for her skin when she doesn't have the time to do more in-depth analysis and can't stick to an effective routine due to work and travel. Our solution should deliver personalized recommendations and direction for building a successful long lasting routine with the most compatible products.”

                  </div>
                  <div class="col">
                    <p>After signing up users are guided through a survey where they answer questions about the characteristics of their skin. During our research interviews we learned that skincare enthusiasts love talking about their skin and would want to take a survey if it could help them find better products. Shël’s survey is designed to do just that. Each user’s survey results will be linked to a matching system that determines how compatible their skin type and budget is to a product.

                      <div class="col">
                        <p>When designing the routine setup screens we wanted each user to be able to set up their routine with ease. Whether a user has a routine that does not differ from day to day or if a user cycles through many products, changing their routine for each day of the week. We designed the notifications which remind users to complete their routines to be determined by them, flexible to their schedules.

                            <p>When conducting our competitor analysis we felt why users were frustrated while researching products on apps such as Picky and ThinkDirty. Information about products was not easy to digest. Tasks such as reviewing a product ingredient within a product page often took as many as 6 clicks and even then a user was only able to view one ingredient at a time before having to go back to the previous screen and select another ingredient to view. Our research revealed that analyzing ingredients of a product is important to users so we wanted to present that information in a quick and friendly way.

                        <p><strong>Outcomes and Results</strong> | Testing of our prototype revealed excitement for Shël to continue through to development. User’s shared anecdotes as to how they would use or benefit from the different aspects of the Shël app. One user liked the customization of the routine notifications and imagined setting up a routine for applying sunscreen while on vacation. We are openly accepting feedback from users to hear what else they want to see within our app, such as how one user shared they want the ability to upload photos of their skin to track how products they are using affect their skin’s appearance.
